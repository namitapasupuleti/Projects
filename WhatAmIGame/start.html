      <h3>Inspired by the riddle card game "What Am I?"</h3>

      <h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>One hint will appear before you, and you must guess what the thing is based off of it.</li>
        <li>If you cannot get it, you can ask for a second and third hint.</li>
        <li>If you guess correctly based off of the first hint, you get 3 points. If you guess correctly based off of the first and second hints, you get 2 points. If you guess correctly based off of all three hints, you get 1 point. If you don't guess correctly or skip the riddle, you get 0 points.</li>
        <li>The more riddles you guess correctly, the more points you get!</li>
