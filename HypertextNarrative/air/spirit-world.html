            For years, you had spent your life traveling around the world as an air nomad with your Flying Sky Bison. You enjoyed exploring and learning about the world. You had met the people of Kyoshi Island, lived for years in the Eastern Air Temple, and even met hippies cliaming to be nomads too. However there was one place you had always wanted to go that was very difficult to get to: Wan Shi Tong's Library. The library was an enormous library that was once located in the human world, but is now only in the Spirit World. The library was once considered to be very difficult to locate in the human world, as it was almost completely buried under desert sand.  Wan Shi Tong, an owl spirit, built the library with the intention of preserving all the knowledge of the world. It held a vast, ancient collection of books, gathered by Knowledge Seeker spirits. Wan Shi Tong hoped humans would benefit from the vast amount of information. However, some humans sought secrets that would destroy their enemies. Angered by the abuse of his knowledge, Wan Shi Tong closed the library. You being a lover of learning had an enromous desire to visit the library and read all the books you could and learn as much as possible to share with the other air nomads.

            After years and years of meditating with the monks of the Southern Air Temple in order to cross into the spirit world, one day you finally managed to make it into the spirit world. The spirit world was like nothing you had ever seen before. There were so many different colors. Trees were purple, bushes were magenta, mushrooms were talking spirits, and giant spiders hid in trees. You spent a whilie simply expoloring the world, until you stumbled across a large upsidedown structure. It looked like a palace but also very familiar. You realized it was actually the library! Through the magic of the spirit world, you floated up to the building and entered through a tower with windows. Once you were inside the world turned right-side up and the library looked normal. You were stunnded. You had found the library, and it was bigger than you thought. Books lined the walls and there must have been 8 floors worth of book cases. Once you landed on the first level, you were greeted by the owl spirit Wan Shi Tong. He told you that you are welcome to browse his collection if you first shared a piece of knowledge with him. You can him maps that you created on your journey around the world. He accepted them and allowed you to wander the library. Your dream of finding the library had come to fruition. You felt as if you could spend an enternity in there.
